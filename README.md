# Get Started React
The title of my final year project is Virtual Event Management for Entrepreneurs.
I will be using React to build my project frontend. This readme is meant to illustrate the step I took to get started with React, and to document my learning process, whether I successfully built it for my project or gave up.

## Setup React
1. Download Node.js and visual studio code IDE. [Node.js Website](https://nodejs.org/en) [Download Link for VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
2. Create React App (a command-line interface tool allow us to quickly create and run app with no configuration). [Create React App Documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started)
3. Open Visual Studio Code, create a folder for your project, and click **Terminal > New Terminal** write "npx create-react-app **YOUR APP NAME**".
